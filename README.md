## Challenge 
Create a free exchange rate app with an API for currency conversion along with another API for country specific data related to the two currencies.  

## Solution
A react app produced a free site that's vissually appealing with animated elements and ease of use. 2 APIs provide fast currency conversion and country data, including country flags. The user login information is encrypted and stored in 2 tables in a PostgreSQL database. The backend routes sign-in information to the database and API responses. The server was built with Node for non-blocking runtime, and Express for http requests. 

## Result
An attractive, intuitive, and performant app that converts one currency into another at varying amounts and provides interesting information about the countries related to the currencies.
